My name is Trevor, and I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Boston University. I am originally from Roanoke, Virgina and attended Virginia Tech for my undergraduate degreee in Mathematics. After spending a year working as a software engineer, I returned to Virginia Tech and completed my Master's degree. My Master's thesis was titled "Galerkin Approximations of General Delay Differential Equations with Multiple Discrete or Distributed Delays" and can be found [here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/83825).

I am current advisor is Gene Wayne, and my research focuses on dynamcial systems, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. In particular, I have projects focusing on the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Lattice and the nonlinear Poisson Bolztmann equation. In my free time, I like to crochet, run, and learn about data science.
