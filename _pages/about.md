My name is Trevor, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Virginia Tech. I am originally from Roanoke, Virgina and attended Boston University for my Ph.D. in Mathematics. While my graduate studies focused on Mathematical Physics, Dynamical Systems, and Partial Differential Equations, my current work focuses on applying Machine Learning. My current project focuses on using machine learning to improve coarse-grained models of proteins.
