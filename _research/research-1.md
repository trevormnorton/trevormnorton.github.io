The Fermin-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice is an infinite system of ODEs. It has been shown for certain potential functions that the Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) equation can be used as a modulation equation for small-amplitude, long-wavelength solutions of the lattice. This fact led to the discovery of solitary wave solutions on the lattice. This project investigates using the modified KdV (mKdV) as a modulation equation for different potential functions. From this, it is possible to show the existence of kink-like solutions on the lattice. The results will be part of my upcoming thesis.
