The Nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann Equation (NPBE) is a model frequently used for protein interations inside an ionic fluid. This project shows that under certain assumptions that the solutions of the NPBE vary analytically with respect to the parameters. This result has applications to Uncertainty Quantification when modeling ligand-receptor interactions.
